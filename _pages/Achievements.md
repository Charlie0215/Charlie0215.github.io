### Project
1. Learnable Image ISP Pipeline 
   Image ISP is a critical processing unit that maps RAW images from the camera sensor to RGB images. The traditional ISP pipeline requires manually tuning each sub-processing unit that takes legions of efforts from imagery experts. To tackle with this downside, we design a novel network to enable a learnable ISP pipeline that enhances smartphone images and mitigates artifacts from the camera sensor. In AIM2020 learned image ISP challenge, our proposed solution outperformed the state-of-the-arts and achieve very high MOS (4.5 out of 5) while remaining competitive in numerical results (21.86dB in PSNR). See more details [[here](https://github.com/Charlie0215/AIM2020.git)]

2. Single & Burst Image Demoiring
   We proposed a new network, named Cube-DemoireNet, which enhances the conventional multi-scale network by 1) facilitating information exchange across different scales and stages to alleviate the underlying bottleneck issue, and 2) employing the attention mechanism to identify the dynamic Moir√© patterns, and thus eliminate the ones effectively with the preservation of image texture.

3. Snake Game with Deep Q-Learning
   A snake game with an AI agent. This program is designed in a way that both users or AI can take in control so that enables users to compete with AI. This project is mainly built on PyTorch and PyGame. See more details [[here](https://github.com/Charlie0215/deep-q-snake-pytorch.git)].
